# Ai-Autonomous-Car
Self-driving car implementation using Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model trained on TORCS simulator data. Built with PyTorch for autonomous vehicle navigation.

An AI-powered autonomous driving agent for the TORCS (The Open Racing Car Simulator) game using neural networks.

## Overview
This project implements a self-driving car agent that can autonomously navigate tracks in TORCS using a trained Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model.

## Features
- Data collection through manual gameplay
- MLP neural network implementation using PyTorch
- Model training and optimization
- Real-time integration with TORCS driver interface

## Technologies Used
- Python
- PyTorch
- Neural Networks (MLP)
- TORCS Simulator

## How it Works
1. Collected training data by manually playing TORCS
2. Developed and trained MLP model using PyTorch
3. Integrated trained model (.pkl and .pth files) into TORCS driver
4. Achieved autonomous navigation and control
